 <p  style="font-size: 30px;">Humans seek to make everything in the service of the IOT technology. However, there are some points to be clear about the programming used in IOT and its types. Although in the IOT domain many different standards are still struggling to be the
    Reference 1 and the most adopted, in this section we focus specifically on The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards because they are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices, and can count on a wide community. 
    </p>
  <p  style="font-size: 30px;">The IETF standards for IOT embrace a web service architecture for IOT services, which has been widely documented in the literature as a very promising and flexible approach. Web services permit to realize a flexible and interoperable system that can be extended to IOT nodes, through the adoption of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State Transfer (ReST) [18]. IOT services designed following the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption and use of IOT by both end-users and service developers, which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge gained from traditional web technologies in the development of services for networks containing smart objects. The web service approach is also promoted by international standardization bodies such as IETF, ETSI, and W3C, among others, as well as European research projects on the IOT such as SENSEI,5 IOT-A,6 and SmartSantander.</p>
