<h3 style="font-size: 50px;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">THE Internet of Things (IOT) is a recent communication paradigm that envisions a near future, in which the objects of everyday life will be equipped with microcontrollers, transceivers for digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will make them able to communicate with one another and with the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet. The IOT concept aims at making the Internet even more immersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IOT will foster the development of several applications that make use of the 
  Potentially enormous amount and variety of data generated by such objects to provide new services to citizens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm indeed finds application in many different domains, such as home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile healthcare, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management and smart grids, automotive, traffic management, and many others.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">However, such a heterogeneous field of application makes the identification of solutions capable of satisfying the requirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable challenge. This difficulty has led to the proliferation of different and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical realization of IOT systems. Therefore, from a system perspective, the realization of an IOT network, together with the required backend network services and devices, still lacks an established best practice because of its novelty and complexity. In addition to the technical difficulties, the adoption of the IOT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and widely 
  Accepted business model that can attract investments to promote the deployment of these technologies.
  </p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">"It's about networks, it's about devices, and it's about data," Caroline Gorski, the head of IOT at Digital Catapult explains. IOT allows devices on closed private internet connections to communicate with others and "the Internet of Things brings those networks together. It allows devices to communicate not only within close silos but also across different networking types and creates a much more connected world</p>
