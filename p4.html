<p style="font-size: 30px;" >An argument has been raised that only because something can be connected to the internet does not mean it should be, but each device collects data for a specific purpose that may be useful to a buyer and affect the wider economy.</p>
<p style="font-size: 30px;" >Within industrial applications, sensors on product lines can increase efficiency and cut down on waste. One-study estimates 35 percent of US manufacturers are using data from smart sensors within their set-ups already. US firm Concrete Sensors has created a device that can be inserted into concrete to provide data on the material's condition, for instance.</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 40px;" >There are some applications:</h1>
<ol>
<li style="font-size: 35px;" >IOT Applications – Wearables</li>
       <p style="font-size: 30px;">Wearable technology is a hallmark of IOT applications and probably is one of the earliest industries to have deployed the IOT at its service. We happen to see Fit Bits, heart rate monitors, and smartwatches everywhere these days. One of the lesser-known wearables includes the Guardian glucose-monitoring device. The device is developed to aid people suffering from diabetes. It detects glucose levels in the body, using a tiny 

       Electrode called glucose sensor placed under the skin and relays the information via Radio Frequency to a monitoring device.</p>
<li style="font-size: 35px;">IOT Applications – Smart Home Applications</li>      
       <p style="font-size: 30px;">When we talk about IOT Applications, Smart Homes are probably the first thing that we think of. The best example I can think of here is Jarvis, the AI home automation employed by Mark Zuckerberg. There is also Allen Pan’s Home Automation System where functions in the house are actuated by use of a string of musical notes. The following video could give you a better idea.</p>
<li style="font-size: 35px;">IOT Applications – Health Care</li>
       <p style="font-size: 30px;">IOT applications can turn reactive medical-based systems into proactive wellness-based systems. The resources that current medical research uses, lack critical real-world information. It mostly uses leftover data, controlled environments, and volunteers for medical examination. IOT opens ways to a sea of valuable data through analysis, real-time field data, and testing. The Internet of Things also improves the current devices in power, precision, and availability. IOT focuses on creating systems rather than just equipment. Moreover, that is how an IOT-enabled care device works.</p>

<li style="font-size: 35px;">IOT Applications – Smart Cities</li>       
       <p style="font-size: 30px;">By now, I assume, most of you must have heard about the term Smart City. The hypothesis of the optimized traffic system I mentioned earlier is one of the many aspects that constitute a smart city.
        The thing about the smart city concept is that it is very specific to a city. The problems faced in Mumbai are very different from those in Delhi. The problems in Hong Kong are different from New York. Even global issues, like finite clean drinking water, deteriorating air quality, and increasing urban density, occur in different intensities across cities. Hence, they affect each city differently.
        The Government and engineers can use IOT to analyze the often-complex factors of town planning specific to each city. The use of IOT applications can aid in areas like water management, waste control, and emergencies.

<li style="font-size: 50px;">5. IOT Applications – Industrial Automation</li>
       <p style="font-size: 30px;">This is one of the fields where both faster developments, as well as the quality of products, are the critical factors for a higher Return on Investment. With IOT Applications, one could even re-engineer products and their packaging to deliver 

        Better performance in both cost and customer experience. IOT here can prove to be game changing with solutions for all the following domains in its arsenal.
